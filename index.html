        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me balanced and inspired. I'm passionate about sports, especially football ⚽ and MMA 🥊, which push me to stay active, focused, and constantly improve. I also love going for walks around the city 🏙️ — it's a great way to clear my mind and discover new places. When I want to relax, I turn to my PlayStation 🎮, where I unwind and dive into immersive gaming experiences. These moments outside of work help me stay creative, motivated, and connected to what I love.</p>

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <p>I'm currently working on two personal projects that are close to my heart. The first is building a small event agency 🎉, where I can combine creativity and organization to bring unique experiences to life. The second involves contributing to a humanitarian association 🤝, which allows me to support meaningful causes and make a positive impact. Both projects have been incredible opportunities to grow personally and professionally, while applying my skills in real-world, purpose-driven contexts.</p>
